# Figure Index

This repo generates figures under `figures/` and some under `Results/` subfolders.

Key scripts:
- `scripts/07_fig9_percentile_concordance.py` : Fig.9-style percentile-rank concordance (CP–MI vs SHAP)
- `scripts/05_shap_vs_cpmi_stability_concordance.py` : stability + concordance plots (per-platform)
- `scripts/01_full_multiwin_multik_pipeline.py` : DSE ROC/PR artifacts (saved to Results/ and/or figures depending on config)

Update this file to map exact paper figure numbers to output filenames after you finalize filenames.
