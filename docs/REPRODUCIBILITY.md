# Reproducibility

## Quickstart

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate xoctane
export XOCTANE_DATA_DIR=/path/to/data
bash scripts/reproduce_all.sh
```

## Outputs

- `Results/` : metrics CSVs and summaries produced by the pipeline
- `FeatureRankOUT/` : CP–MI feature ranking outputs
- `Results/Explainability*` : SHAP outputs (as produced by the notebook-derived scripts)
- `figures/` : figures generated by plotting scripts

## Notes

These scripts were extracted from `notebooks/XOCTANE.ipynb` and patched to remove
machine-specific absolute paths. They rely on `XOCTANE_DATA_DIR` for data location.
